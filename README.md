<h2>QUESTION - 03</h2>

<p>  
  My implementation of the challenge consists of the main method as the main starting point and 3 auxiliary methods.In main, the program will run several instances by calling auxiliary methods or issuing defined outputs.
  <ul>
      <li>The purpose of the "collect_operators(String input)" method is to receive the operation text, filter and return in order all the addition and subtraction         operators of the calculation.</li>
      <li>In collect_numbers(String input), the text input is iterated and the numbers that will participate in the operation are collected and returned in the             original order of the operation.</li>
      <li>The third auxiliary method operation(List<String> operators, List<String> numbers, int operands), receives the list with the operators and another of the         operands, as well as the number of operands. Processing consists of iterating over the number of numbers developing the operator analysis logic and addition or       subtraction operation and outputting the result at the end.</li>
  </ul>
