<h2>QUESTION - 02</h2>

<p>  
  My implementation of the challenge consists of the main method as the main starting point and 3 auxiliary methods.In main, the program will run and call auxiliary methods or issuing defined outputs.
  <ul>
      <li>In the "input_message()" method, the message to be analyzed is collected and returned in String format.</li>
      <li>The "count_of_ocourrences(String text, String symbol)" method receives the text entered by the user and a symbol to be searched for. It can count several             input symbols and is used for counting the two symbols in two different invocations of the method.</li>
      <li>The method "sentiment_expressed(int happy_faces, int upset_faces)" makes the difference between the two occurrence quantities and defines the sentiment of             the input.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
